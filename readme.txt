The github repo: https://github.com/chase-rebstock-TU/Project1

This targets a Mac operating system and my test cases were pushed to Safari,
but should work on Chrome as well

AI was used just for syntax purposes to ensure proper rust syntax was followed

I copied the compiler into the bin file, but it is also inside of target/release and I
ran and tested by running cargo build --release and then ./target/release/Project1 tests/Test10.lol 
for example in the terminal.

i was a little confused for the rustdoc portion but there is a doc piece inside of the target folder
